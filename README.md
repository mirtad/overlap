Compiling
=========

After cloning the repository, run make from the src directory to generate executable files.

To remove executable files run make clean from the src directory.


Running
=======

To run the overlapper type:

./overlap READS_FILE OUTPUT_FILE THREADS_NO

e.g. ./overlap ../reads/ecoli_500.fasta ecoli_500.out 4

You can run the suffix array and longest common prefix array check by typing:

./sa_lcp_test READS_FILE

e.g. ./sa_lcp_test ../reads/ecoli_500.fasta


About
=====

This is a small tool for overlapping pacbio reads generated by readsim available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/readsim/. To find overlaps, it uses a generalized suffix array (implemented according to "Linear Suffix Array Construction by Almost Pure Induced-Sorting" by Nong et al.) and a longest common prefix array (implemented according to "Linear-Time Longest-Common-Prefix Computation in Suffix Arrays and Its Applications" by Kasai et al.). It evaluates the generated overlaps against the data from the reads file and outputs the confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score.

This tool uses an implementation of Myers's "Fast Bit-Vector Algorithm for Approximate String Matching Based on Dynamic Programming" that works with strings of arbitrary length available at http://github.com/Martinsos/Myers.
